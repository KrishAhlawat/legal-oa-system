Constitutional law establishes the framework of government and protects fundamental rights. The U.S. Constitution divides power among three branches: legislative, executive, and judicial. The Bill of Rights guarantees essential freedoms including speech, religion, press, and assembly under the First Amendment. The Fourteenth Amendment provides equal protection and due process, applying most Bill of Rights protections to state governments. Judicial review allows courts to determine the constitutionality of laws and executive actions. Constitutional interpretation involves various methodologies including originalism, textualism, and living constitutionalism. The Commerce Clause grants Congress broad power to regulate interstate commerce. Constitutional amendments require ratification by three-fourths of state legislatures.
