Contract law governs agreements between parties. A valid contract requires offer, acceptance, and consideration. The offer must be clear and definite, communicated to the offeree. Acceptance must be unconditional and mirror the terms of the offer. Consideration is something of value exchanged between parties, which can be a promise, an act, or forbearance. Without consideration, a contract may be unenforceable unless it falls under exceptions like promissory estoppel. Courts examine whether mutual assent existed at the time of contract formation. Both parties must have legal capacity to enter into a contract, meaning they are of legal age and sound mind.
