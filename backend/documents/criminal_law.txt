Criminal law defines offenses against society and prescribes punishments. Crimes are classified as felonies, misdemeanors, or infractions based on severity. A felony is a serious crime punishable by imprisonment for more than one year, while misdemeanors carry lighter sentences. To convict a defendant, the prosecution must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Criminal liability requires both actus reus (guilty act) and mens rea (guilty mind). Defenses include alibi, self-defense, insanity, and duress. The criminal justice system protects defendants' constitutional rights, including the right to counsel, the right to remain silent, and protection against unreasonable searches and seizures under the Fourth Amendment.
