Tort law addresses civil wrongs that cause harm or loss to individuals. The primary torts include negligence, intentional torts, and strict liability. Negligence occurs when a party fails to exercise reasonable care, resulting in harm to another. To establish negligence, a plaintiff must prove duty of care, breach of that duty, causation, and damages. Intentional torts include assault, battery, false imprisonment, and defamation. These require proof that the defendant intentionally committed the wrongful act. Strict liability applies in certain cases regardless of fault, such as product liability or abnormally dangerous activities. Tort remedies typically involve monetary damages to compensate the injured party.
