Property law governs ownership and tenancy rights in real and personal property. Real property refers to land and anything permanently attached to it, while personal property includes movable items. Ownership can be held as fee simple absolute, life estate, or leasehold. Fee simple absolute provides the most complete ownership rights. Easements grant non-possessory rights to use another's property for specific purposes. Adverse possession allows someone to gain ownership through continuous, open, and hostile possession for a statutory period. Landlord-tenant law governs rental agreements, requiring landlords to maintain habitable conditions and tenants to pay rent and avoid property damage. Transfer of property typically requires a deed that meets formal requirements.
